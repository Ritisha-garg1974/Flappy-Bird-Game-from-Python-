# Flappy Bird in Python
### Using pygame library


The objective of the project:- Flappy game is one of the most common games played by everyone! But what about making a clone of it and then playing it. Won't it be much fun? Hence, this project is all about creating a Flappy Bird game in python using pygame. The user would be able to see the score together with all types of interesting sounds like hit, swoosh, die, point, and wing. Also, the randomness of pipes makes the game more captivating.

## Steps of the project

Part 1: Importing the libraries and declaring global variables 

Part 2: We will write the main function which would load all the required images and the audio.

Part 3: Create welcomeScreen function which places all the required images on the screen and blit them.

Part 4: We will create mainGame next, this function would get the random pipes, set the velocities and accelerations of the sprites, and has all the conditions required in the game.

Part 5: Creating the isCollide function to check if the bird has collided or not and do the necessary stuff if collided.

Part 6: Creating the getRandomPipe function to get the randomness of pipes. 

Part 7: Result



## Note

Create a folder named Flappy Bird. In this folder create another folder named Gallary and main.py.
main.py will have the code and Gallary will again have 2 folders : sprites(all the images required) and audio( the audio files which has been used in the project).
